## Main Discussion Points

- **Standardization**: Importance of standardizing methodologies and reporting for fluorescence lifetime imaging and metabolic analysis.
- **Technical considerations**: Includes diffraction effects, contamination from fluorescent protein emission, and analysis methods (phasors and lifetimes).
- **Open-source collaboration**: Sharing of open-source code and tools (PhasorPy, MSSR).
- **Language transition**: Movement from other languages (MATLAB, Java) to Python for better collaboration and community adoption.
